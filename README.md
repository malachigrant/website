# Introduction

This is a starter pack for React apps, aimed at beginners, but could easily be used by experts. Packages included are Webpack, Babel, React, ESLint, Prettier, and Emotion. These are what I have personally used, and I feel they work well together. ESLint config is setup to use recommended settings, and Prettier is set up to use my preferred configuration, feel free to change these if these defaults don't suit your needs.

# Tool needed

You will need yarn or npm. These instructions assume you use yarn, if you prefer npm, just replace `yarn` with `npm install` in the instructions.

# To run

1. Fork this repository and clone it.
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn dev`

# Linting and prettifying

To 'prettify' your code, run `yarn pretty`. To check for linting errors, run `yarn lint`.

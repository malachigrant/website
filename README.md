# Introduction

This is my starter website!

# To run

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn dev`

# Extra commands

1. To run prettier: `yarn pretty`
2. To lint the code: `yarn lint`
3. To publish: `yarn publish` (additional instructions below)

# Publishing

I am using Github Pages to host this website, which serves content from a repository.
Rather than cluttering this repository, I opted to create a different repository inside of my /dist folder. Then I added a publish script to automatically build this and then commit and push to the other repository.
